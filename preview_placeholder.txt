# Preview Image Placeholder

This file would contain a preview.jpg image for the mod manager.

To create the actual preview image:
1. Take a screenshot showing the combined physics effects in action
2. Include multiple destruction types (crumbling, particles, collapse)
3. Save as preview.jpg (512x512 recommended)
4. Replace this file with the actual image

Suggested preview content:
- Split-screen showing before/after destruction
- Multiple physics systems active simultaneously
- High-quality visual effects demonstration
- Clear branding "Physics Combination Mod"
