name = Physics Combination Mod
author = Combined Mod Integration
description = A comprehensive physics enhancement mod that combines Progressive Destruction, Impact Based Structural Integrity (IBSIT), and Mass Based Collateral System (MBCS) into a unified, configurable physics simulation. Features dual options menus accessible from both mod manager and pause menu.

Features:
- Progressive Destruction: Advanced debris management, wind/force systems, crumbling mechanics, explosions
- IBSIT: Physics-based structural integrity, realistic building collapse, material-specific damage
- MBCS: Mass-based collateral detection, proximity collapse triggering
- Dual Options System: Configure all systems from mod manager or in-game pause menu
- Performance Optimization: Intelligent FPS management and debris cleanup
- Modular Design: Enable/disable individual systems independently
